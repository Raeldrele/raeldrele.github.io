  <h2>Introduction:</h2>
	 <p><strong>Personal Background:</strong> <br>I’m a Charlotte native. I like to travel. I have a cat and he is a jerk.</p>
	 <p><strong>Professional Background:</strong> <br>I’ve worked as a journalist, a janitor, a technology trainer, and a soccer 
		 coach.  I recently left a lengthy stint with a government agency to be a database administrator for a 
		 construction and design company.</p>
	 <p><strong>Academic Background:</strong> <br>I have a college degree but I’m really interested in data work.  I decided to 
		 take classes at CPCC part time in 2018 to change careers.  I attended an information session for UNCC but they 
		 said CPCC was about one-third the tuition.  I’ve been very happy with my classes at CPCC, except when a 
		 tornado interrupted my midterm and my instructor wouldn’t let me reschedule. I highly recommend CSC 124 with 
		 Michael Weinburg.  I learned a lot in that class I could immediately apply.</p>
	  <p><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> <br>I enjoy coding.  I’ve spent the most time with SQL and recently taught
		  a beginner class on it.</p>
	  <p><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> <br>A Dell laptop running Windows 8.  My coursework has not been kind to my 
		  laptop and it occasionally protests, but I’m really hoping I can coax it along until May. I do have large extra 
		  monitors and an adjustable desk (silver lining of the pandemic).</p>
	  <p><strong>Courses I'm Taking and Why:</strong> 
	<br>
	 <ul>
	 <li><strong>Web 250:</strong> - Database Driven Websites: substitute course for CTI 289: CTI Capstone Project.  
		 This is required for me to finish my degree.</li>
	 <li><strong>CTI 260:</strong> - Data Center Troubleshooting: substitute course for DBA 210 Database Administration. 
		 This is required for me to finish my degree.</li>
	 <li><strong>DBA 285:</strong> - Data Warehousing & Mining: Required for my degree but sounds like fun!</li>
	 </ul></p>
	<p><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</strong> <br>My brother works for the evil empire, also known as Meta. 
		He wants me to join the dark side.</p>
	<p><strong>I'd also like to Share:</strong> <br>I’m pro Oxford comma, and <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/43303747/">this/> is hilarious. </p>
