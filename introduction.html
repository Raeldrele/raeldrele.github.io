  <h2>Introduction:</h2>
	 <p><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I’m a Charlotte native. I like to travel. I have a cat and he is a jerk.</p>
	 <p><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I’ve worked as a journalist, a janitor, a technology trainer, and a soccer 
		 coach.  I recently left a lengthy stint with a government agency to be a database administrator for a 
		 construction and design company.</p>
	 <p><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I have a college degree but I’m really interested in data work.  I decided to 
		 take classes at CPCC part time in 2018 to change careers.  I attended an information session for UNCC but they 
		 said CPCC was about one-third the tuition.  I’ve been very happy with my classes at CPCC, except when a 
		 tornado interrupted my midterm and my instructor wouldn’t let me reschedule. I highly recommend CSC 124 with 
		 Michael Weinburg.  I learned a lot in that class I could immediately apply.</p>
