    <h2>Contract</h2>
	
	  <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Katherine Engelbrecht</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in WEB250 with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
   <p> I understand that all work that I do on publically available online tools will be available to the world, and I will not put 
	   information there that is innappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
   <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in 
	   assignments may show as absences.</p>
   <p>- Katherine Engelbrecht, 1/20/2023</p>
